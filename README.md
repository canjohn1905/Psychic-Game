# Psychic-Game
Here in this game I worked onn the CSS and HTML to give a user-friendly layout since it was my first assigment where I had to code javascripts to make the game work!

How it works?
You input/guess a letter
If the input matches with computer's choice 
It adds a win to the players dashboard

Could be improved?
Layout 
Javascripts code 
Win and lose functionallty
